Bradly Schlenker's portfolio website at [bradly.me](http://bradly.me/).

## Introduction

This is a portfolio website that I created from cool-kitten originally. It has since become so differnet that I've reuploaded the repo as a non-fork.

## Usage

Clone. Modify HTML and CSS to your desire. Maybe add some new images! Upload to a public directory and booya!

## Contributing

Nah, don't bother. I don't need contributions unless you got something really cool to mention or you noticed a bug.
